# userspace-fat-filesystem

Simple FAT12/16/32 filesystem with a shell to do some basic work.

This is done as a school homework. FAT code is from some FUSE driver; I implemented a simple shell and some FUSE adapter. 

## Compile

Makefile is provided. Requires GCC. (Clang should work too.)

## Usage

Type `help`.
